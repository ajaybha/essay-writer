        content='This is a good start!  The imagery is strong and evocative.  However, the poem feels a bit repetitive.  "Softly sweet" and "rhythmic beat" are a bit close in meaning, and the final stanza uses similar phrasing ("endless mist").  Try to vary the language and explore different aspects of the sea.  Consider what *specific* secrets the sea whispers, or what specific feeling the sun-kissed spray evokes.  What is the *unique* character of the sea in this moment?  More sensory details would also strengthen the poem.  For example, instead of "a timeless feat," try something more evocative.\n',
